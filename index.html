<p>Alyse is an intern for the program C.H.R.I.S. 180. She is 21 years old. She is originally from New York, but stayed in Atlanta for 11 years. She loves to dance, and she is the president of an honor society at Clark. She loves the color red, and her favorite food is sea food. Any Marvel Avengers movie is her favorite movie, so she is really excited to see that Black Widow is getting her own movie. She is the youngest out of 5 kids, being a friendly anti-social person. Her favorite video games are Mortal Kombat, Call of Duty, and The Last of Us. When she was younger, she would take karate as an influence of Mortal Kombat, and actually thinks that video games help make others reflexes sharper. She works as a Social worker at Clark University. </p>
